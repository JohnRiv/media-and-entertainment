covers
Web
technologies
used

—
including
capture,
production,

—
of
continuous
<del class="diff-old">media,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">experiences,
</ins>
which
<del class="diff-old">is

</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">text,

the
Interest
Group
include:
</p>
<ul>

<p>
The
tasks
that

will
undertake
include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Identification
of
requirements
for
tighter
support
of
media-centric
applications
on
the
Web
platform,
possibly
through
the
creation
of
Task
Forces
</li>
<li>
Incubation
of
technical

requirements
by
supporting

creation
of
Community

focusing
on
particular
topics
</li>
<li>
Suggesting
existing
Working
Groups
to
include
particular
topics
in

as
appropriate
</li>
<li>
Tracking

specifications.
</li>
<li>
Ensuring
issues
of
accessibility,
device
independence,
internationalization,

Decision
Policy
</h2>
<p>
This
group
will
seek
to
make
decisions
through
consensus
and
due
process,
per
the
<a href= "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">
W3C
Process
Document
(section
3.3
</a>
).
Typically,
an
editor
or
other
participant
makes
an
initial
proposal,
which
is
then
refined
in
discussion
with
members
of
the
group
and
other
reviewers,
and
consensus
emerges
with
little
formal
voting
being
required.
</p>
<p>
However,
if
a
decision
is
necessary
for
timely
<del class="diff-old">progress,
but
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">progress
and
</ins>
consensus
is
not
achieved
after
careful
consideration
of
the
range
of
views
presented,
the
Chairs
may
call
for
a
group
<del class="diff-old">vote,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">vote
</ins>
and
record
a
decision
along
with
any
objections.
</p>
<p>
To
afford
asynchronous
decisions
and
organizational
deliberation,
any
resolution
(including
publication
decisions)
taken
in
a
face-to-face
meeting
or
teleconference
will
be
considered
provisional.
A
call
for
consensus
(CfC)
will
be
issued
for
all
resolutions
(for
example,
via
email
and/or
web-based
survey),
with
a
response
period
from

week
to
