Media Production on the Web
===========================

Background
----------

Professional media assets, including audio-visual masters for television and motion pictures, are increasingly being stored in the cloud.

There is a corresponding growing interest in building web applications that allow end-users to manipulate these assets, e.g., quality checking, versioning, timed text authoring, etc.
While the web platform has evolved to support consumer media applications, professional applications require additional capabilities, including precise timing, wider color gamut and high-dynamic range, high-fidelity timed text, etc.

Problem statement
-----------------

What are the current technical challenges, and future opportunities, for professional media applications on the Web, and how should they be addressed by the Web Platform?

Potential topics
----------------

* How can a video editing application reach a specific frame of an arbitrary media stream?

* What is missing to enable color grading within a web application?

* What is missing to enable monitoring visual effects in real time?

* Support for professional video codecs, e.g. JPEG 2000, etc.

* Support for HDR and WCG color spaces, e.g. P3D65, etc.

* In general, media playback on the Web usually favors user experience over fidelity to the initial content. Professional media application need to run in high-fidelity mode, e.g. for timed text. Can new features or new technologies help in this regard?

* Are there specific formats that professional media applications need to support? Are these formats suitable for use in Web browsers?

* What are common mechanisms used within professional media applications to process media efficiently? Would specific APIs for media processing help?

* What techniques can professional media applications use and what additional capabilities could help to localize media content?

* What capabilities - APIs, semantics, techniques for rendering, processing, personalization, customization, interoperability, etc. - can developers leverage to ensure accessibility of media content authoring tools and of the media content produced?

Stakeholders
------------

* Post-production tools editors, e.g. linear and non-linear video editing, dubbing, special effects, QC, timed text editing, etc.

* Production and post-production service providers

* Content distributors

* Browser vendors
